Miro Board:

Plan is to implement the user story one by one and build up the domain model and CRC cards as the user stories are developed - following TDD and avoid implementing any unnecessary requirements.

NOte I have decided to call my app Shouter and you Shout!

## Step 1
Will implement User story 1

> User Story 1

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order
> Peeps should have a time stamp, author, content
> display all peeps in chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

>already implemented time
> will now implement a database model
